## Smith-Waterman Similarity Matrix Calculator

Here we we're doing a multi-threaded approach for optimization and speeding up the process for calculating the simialrity matrix in the Smith-Waterman algorithm! Which you can read about it [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith%E2%80%93Waterman_algorithm)

The result of timing this multi-threaded approach running 100 times repeatedly is
as following:

# Total Time --> 12.305s
